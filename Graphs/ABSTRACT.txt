This study explores whether the format of computer identifiers—camelCase or kebab-case—impacts reading performance. Using a custom web-based application, 30 participants completed tasks requiring them to locate specific identifiers from lists containing distractors, under controlled conditions. Participants were categorized by programming experience (beginner or advanced) and age (under 40 or 40 and older) to evaluate potential variability. The study utilized a multi-factor, within-subject design, ensuring that each participant was exposed to both identifier formats across 20 randomized tasks. Performance was measured based on the time taken to correctly identify the target identifier. Statistical analysis revealed no significant difference in reading speed between camelCase and kebab-case identifiers. This finding supports the Null Hypothesis, suggesting that identifier formatting does not significantly influence reading efficiency, regardless of a participant's programming experience or age.
