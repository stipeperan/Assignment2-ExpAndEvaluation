1. introduce the topic of investigation to the reader and motivate why you did the experiment.

2. Write down your (falsifiable!) hypotheses here. Each hypothesis must include independent and 	your dependent variables. You must write down your hypotheses before you do your experiment!

3. section 2.1 entirly completed

4. section 2.2 done all explenatio untill the design of the experiment.

5. Check off the characteristics of your experimental design (only remains to add the figure   	containing all the permutations).

6. Describe who will take / took part in your experiment. Provide descriptive/summative statistics 		of their gender, age, professional backgrounds, and any other characteristics that may be 	  	relevant to your experiment. Also explain how you will recruit / recruited them 		(volunteers recruited through email, classmates who were asked to do this, etc) and how 		you will allocate / allocated them into the different study conditions, i.e., control 		group vs experimental group(s).

7. Describe in sufficient detail any relevant “props” that you used in your experiment. This could 		be the computer you used (exact model and specification), the software used (URL, version 		numbers), the way you measured, e.g., time (A stopwatch? A background process on the 	computer that got automatically triggered?). Omit needless detail (e.g., think whether 	details like the size of the table the laptop was placed on, or the hard disk size, might 		have affected your results or not).
